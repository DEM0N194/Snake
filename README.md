# Snake
My own take at creating a snek game :D

Alright you coontrol the snake obviously with the ARROW keys ... 
BUT if you tap and hold the arrow in which direction you are already going, you will speed up.

Then you have the timer on the top ... if you run out of time you loose one life (The red square on the top left)
You also loose a life if you collide with yourself :P and you bite off you tail .. so be careful :D
Don't worry the if you collide with the gray wall it won't kill you ... 
you'll just come out from the opposite side (My roommate wanted it this way)

I have some plans and features that I want to implement in the future... 
Hopefully I will have some time to do that in the near futre :)


THANKS FOR CHECKING OUT MY SNAKE GAME :)
